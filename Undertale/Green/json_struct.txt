frame:
    VARIABLE: integer
    DESC: The frame the arrow will spawn on, starts from 0, increases by 1 each frame (60 times per second)

type:
    VARIABLE: float
    DESC: The probability for the arrow to be a reverse arrow (yellow arrow), 0.5 is 50%

side:
    VARIABLE: [integer, bool]
    DESC: The side where the arrow will spawn on
    1st arg:
        0: Up
        1: Right
        2: Down
        3: Left
        null: Random side
    2nd arg:
        True to prevent the arrow to spawn on the same side as the previous arrow (for random sides only)

speed:
    VARIABLE: float
    DESC: How much the arrow will travel per frame

fadeout:
    VARIABLE: bool
    DESC: Whether the arrow should fade out when getting close to the player 

dmg:
    VARIABLE: integer
    DESC: How much damage the arrow will deal upon contact (player has 100 HP)

iframes:
    VARIABLE: integer
    DESC: Invincibility length in frame upon contact with player


EXAMPLE:
[10, 0.15, [null, true], 8, false, 10, 30]
This data creates an arrow that:
- spawns on frame 10
- has 15% of being a reverse arrow
- spawns on a random side that differes from the previous arrow's side
- has a speed of 8
- doesn't fade out
- deals 10 HP upon contact
- gives 30 invincibility frames (0.5s)
